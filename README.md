# Word Count Uploader
A sample React app that allows uploading to an endpoint.

## Setup
- Make sure you have the current LTS build of node installed
- Install yarn
- From the root directory, run `yarn`

## Running
- Just use `yarn run start` from the root of the app, and then you can visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), though it should launch the browser on its own.

## Testing
- To see tests run (and hopefully pass) use `yarn run test`
- To see test coverage results `yarn run test:coverage`


## Additional Information
This app was built with create-react-app, for additional information see documentation at their [github page](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
